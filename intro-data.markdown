These notes accompany the [Introduction to Data Short Course Youtube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWwDogT4QAwUlUi2tTh8ac8qEcf1L1vMj).

## Who is this course for?

It's aimed at anybody interested in learning about data and how it affects the world. If you are able to navigate through YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and what social media app you are using, then you will be more than able to watch everything in this course. The aim of this course is to provide an understanding of data to non-technical peeps.

## Prerequisites

The only real prerequisite is for you to have access to YouTube and Excel. No prior knowledge of data things are expected, since this is an introductory course.

## What can you expect with this course?

This course is all about setting the scene with everything to do with data analytics and data science. If you are looking to switch careers to a more data related career, then this is the mini course for you. Even if you aren't looking to switch, this is a friendly introduction to how to work with data since many industries have data all around them.

**Disclaimer**: This little mini series is based on my personal experiences working in the data analytics field after transitioning from a more software engineering background.
