<p>Whaddup people. If you have watched my videos on my channel, you may know that I'm Sashlin. If you haven't watched
    any of my videos, then shame on you, and welcome üòÅ, my name is Sashlin Reddy. I always enjoy telling people about
    myself, because I'm just that interesting üëÄ. So let's get into it.</p>

<p>So why <a
    href="https://youtube/channel/{{ site.youtube_username }}">{{ site.title }}</a>. Why the name? Why did I create the <a
        href="https://youtube/channel/{{ site.youtube_username }}">Youtube Channel</a>/this website? So
    many questions that you guys have for me, or at least the questions that my 3 friends have for me... Over the past
    few
    years I've had a crack at trying to educate others, mainly in the working environment. Turns out it also helps me
    learn and I've found out that education is one of my passions. So this lead me to deciding to attempt to share
    whatever knowledge I've accumulated in a light-hearted way regarding data analytics and data science. And thus, <a
        href="https://youtube/channel/{{ site.youtube_username }}">{{ site.title }}</a> was born. </p>

<p>You might be thinking that <a
    href="https://youtube/channel/{{ site.youtube_username }}">{{ site.title }}</a> is a super weird name. Hell yeah it is, but then again I'm a bit of a
    weird one myself. But that's another discussion for another day. So the name came about after thinking about how I
    would deliver the content. <a href="https://course19.fast.ai/part2">One course</a> in particular inspired me to try
    and teach with more of a <b>top-down</b> approach as opposed to <b>bottom-up</b>. The best example to explain a
    top-down approach, is how sport is taught, such as soccer/football. When kids are taught soccer, they are taught
    just to kick the ball and run after it. Then slowly, over time, the rules are explained. This whole process is like
    peeling back an onion layer by layer, and strangely enough, this was the first thing I thought of when thinking of
    this approach. Also, I LOVE ONIONS in my food üòÅ.
</p>

<p class="mb-5">But who is Sashlin, and why should you watch my videos or read this nonsense? That's a great question.
    I'm just a regular dude trying to share knowledge, because knowledge should be as accessible as possible. I could
    rattle off my credentials, but that's what LinkedIn is for, and also, I just have way too many credentials to list
    all here. Joooking üòÇ I was previously a software developer, but I was intrigued by machine learning after bumping
    into it 5 years ago. Yes, I literally came across machine learning by accident, and now it's one of my passions.
    Anywho, after having two software developer jobs, I became a quantitative analyst at a bank. Somewhere I never
    thought I'd be. It's been challenging trying to implement data science in such a large corporation, but it's these
    type of challenges that got me to learn more, and try help others. And so it began, a couple years ago, in an
    attempt to upskill other quants about data science, I began hosting knowledge shares at work. And since then, I have
    not looked back and we now have <a
    href="https://youtube/channel/{{ site.youtube_username }}">{{ site.title }}</a> üòé.</p>
